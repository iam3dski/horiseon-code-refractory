# horiseon-code-refractory
Corrected website
## Description

Attmepted refractory from previously deployed code. Tried to simplify the code to get it to look cleaner and be more defined. Updated the CSS according to the html changes. Wasn't quite able to figure out some of the code refactorying and ended up breaking website look and had to restore a big section. Want to go back through this later to better identify fixes
